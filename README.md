# TurbomoleScripts
All scripts I've written for interacting with the quantum mechanical calculation package Turbomole. 
I am leaving graduate school and do not anticipate doing further work with
the Turbomole quantum mechanical package. However, I thought the people who do still work
with Turbomole might find some of these scripts useful so I'm making it all publically
available and hopefully readable. 

I have included sample input along with each script, but note the scripts may not
work unless a working version of Turbomole is linked appropriately. 

Be aware that most of these scripts have not been extensively tested and may fail for 
certain corner cases or with different versions of Turbomole.
